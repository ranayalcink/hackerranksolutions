 We need to meet two conditions. 
 If a student's number of total challenges is equal to the maximum number of challenges then we must display the student. 
 If two or more students have the same number of challenges created then we must exclude those students.
 In the first condition of 'having', we state that total_challenges is equal to the maximum total challenges. To find the maximum total challenges, we use the 'order by' to sort total challenges decreasing and we also limit it to 1 to find the maximum.
